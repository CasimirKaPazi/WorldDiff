Modpack for Minetest

WorldDiff automatically saves and loads changes made by players in a map. So you can synchronise maps with other people.

All changes are save as map segments in /worldfolder/wd_output
If you want to load segments by others put them into /worldfolder/wd_input

This modpack depends on WorldEdit.
