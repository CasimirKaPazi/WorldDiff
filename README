Modpack for Minetest

WorldDiff automatically saves and loads changes made by players in a map. So you can synchronise maps with other people.
This is still in heavy development. It is very likely that it will break your map. Make Backups before using it.

All changes are save as map segments in /worldfolder/wd/output in worldedit format.
If you want to load segments by others put them into /worldfolder/wd/input

This modpack depends on WorldEdit.
